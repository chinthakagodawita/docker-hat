# docker-hat
A hat for your Docker!

This is a set of helper commands to run and manage Docker containers on OS X.

## Requirements
* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (>= 0.12)
    - Automatically installed if installing via Homebrew!

## Installation

Super simple with Homebrew, just run the below and you'll be up-and-running in no time:

```bash
brew tap chinthakagodawita/homebrew-dh
brew update
brew install docker-hat
```

## Commands

All commands are simply sub-commands of the `dh` binary. A full list is below (examples coming soon!):

### dh init

Sets up Docker to run on your Mac. This goes off and sets up (via dinghy) the following things:

* Docker host VM (_boot2docker_): To run your containers in, `docker-machine` is used to instrument this
* NFS server (_unfsd_): So that files can be shared to the container without being bottlenecked by VirtualBox's shared folder implementation
* DNS server (_dnsmasq_): Creates a wildcard DNS on `*.docker` which automatically maps to the Docker host
* HTTP proxy (via _nginx_): Allows multiple containers to share the same port

**Usage**

```bash
dh init
```

### dh soe

Starts up a nifty Standard Operating Environment for building various applications in. Currently only supports PHP (with special focus on Drupal & Wordpress) but more coming soon!

See [docker-containers](https://github.com/chinthakagodawita/docker-containers) for a full list and Dockerfiles.

#### Subcommands
##### dh soe start

Start up a new container using one of the special pre-built SOE images.

**Usage**

```bash
dh soe start <container-name>
```

##### dh soe stop

Stop an already-running container.

**Usage**

```bash
dh soe stop <container-name>
```

##### dh soe restart

Restart a running container using the same settings it was started up with.

**Usage**

```bash
dh soe restart <container-name>
```

##### dh soe drush

Run [Drush](http://www.drush.org/en/master/s) inside on of your running containers. Sets up paths correctly so that it executes on your docroot.

**Usage**

```bash
dh soe drush <container-name> [command]
```

### dh exec

Run a command (any command!) in a container.

**Usage**

```bash
dh exec <container-name> <command>
```

**Example**

```bash
dh exec foo tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log
```

### dh shell

Attaches a bash shell to one of your containers and gives your full interactive control. Simply type `exit` to close.

**Usage**

```bash
dh shell <container-name>
```

**Example**

```bash
dh shell foo
```
